    <h1>THE HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT FROM ES1 TO ES6.</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>JavaScript is one of the most well-known globally used software languages in today’s generation.
        It has been there since 1995 but has gone under immense changes and upgrades.
        This programming language was invented by <mark>Bredan Eich</mark> . By 1997 it became an ECMA standard.
        Today we will discuss the origin of this amazing programming language as well as its’ version
        development throughout the years. This article will help you understand JavaScript more in-depth and
        hence will also help you to use it to the fullest.</h3>

                <h4>The very first JavaScript version was ES1 also known as ECMAScript 1.
                    It was released in 1997, followed by the release of ES2 the next year.
                    In 1999, ES3 came with support for many new concepts like regular, linear,
                    constructor expressions, and try-catch block statements.
                    ECMAScript is a standard general-purpose programming language that is conformed by
                    Javascript and some other languages. It is the scripting language that formed the
                    basis of browser-based Javascript and Node. js.The standard of scripting languages
                    like JavaScript is ECMAScript. ECMAScript. The full form of ECMA is European
                    Computer Manufacturer's Association. ECMAScript is a Standard for scripting
                    languages such as JavaScript, JScript, etc. It is a trademark scripting language
                    specification.It is widely used for client-side scripting in web browsers,
                    and it is also used for server-side scripting with node. js. ECMAScript is
                    the successor to JavaScript, and it is backward-compatible with most JavaScript code.
                    To detect the ECMAScript version we can check the object exits into a browser or not.
                    If that object is identified that means ECMA Version supported into the browser.
                    ECMAScript specifies the way of working with the general-purpose programming language,
                    JavaScript. It is the first major update after the ES5 standardized in 2009.
                    ES6 overcomes several limitations of the core language with its new syntax and
                    features including template strings, arrow fiction, and many more.</h4>

                    in 1999.
                    It introduced several important features such as regular expressions, try-catch statements,
                    and improved string handling.ECMAScript 3 (ES3) was released in 1999 and is widely considered to be
                    the version of JavaScript that defined the language for the web. In this article, we'll explore the
                    features and capabilities of ECMAScript 3, along with code examples.
                    ECMAScript 3 was a major milestone in the development of the JavaScript language.
                    Its features and enhancements laid the foundation for the powerful and flexible language that we
                    know today.

                    of
                    browser development, the team behind JScript . NET could work faster and iterate at their
                    discretion.
                    ES4 was met with a bunch of controversies, and lacked sufficient support from browser vendors to be
                    released and was ultimately abandoned. In 2008 the standard was pronounced dead, and ES3. 1 was
                    renamed to ES5,
                    which was a much more conservative and incremental update to ECMAScript.As time passed, it became

                    big for its own weight. The group did not advance as much as they had hoped, and by 2008 many
                    problems still had to be
                    solved before a new standard could be drafted. The ECMAScript 3.1 team, however, had made

                    The sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard is ES6 or ECMAScript 6.
                    It is also known as ECMAScript 2015. ES6 is a major enhancement in the
                    JavaScript language that allows us to write programs for complex applications.
                    ES5 is also known as ECMAScript 2009 as it is released in 2009.
                    It is a function contractors focus on how the objects are instantiated.
                    For ES5 you have to write function keyword and return, to be used to define the function,
                    like normal general JavaScript language.Function Expressions (aka “Anonymous” functions)
                    have many of the same characteristics as function declarations
                    (basic structure, function and return keywords, etc.). However, we store function expressions
                    in a variables, and terminate them with a semicolon (as we do with all variables in
                    JavaScript).ECMAScript 5 on Chrome is fully supported on 23-114,
                    partially supported on 4-22, and not supported on below 4 Chrome versions.
                    ECMAScript 5 on Safari is fully supported on 6.1-16.4, partially supported
                    on 3.2-5, and not supported on below 3.2 Safari versions.In ES5,
                    there is a one way of defining variables using var keyword.
                    But ES6 has introduced two more ways of defining variables using keywords let and const.
                    However, let and const use block scope while var uses function scope.
                    Also, the variables that are defined using const are immutable.</h4>

                    language uses. ECMAScript provides the specification on how JavaScript programming language
                    should work.ES6 or ECMAScript6 is a scripting language specification which is standardized
                    by ECMAScript International. It is used by the applications to enable client-side scripting.
                    This specification is affected by programming languages like Self,
                    Perl, Python, Java, etc.ES6 comes with significant changes to the JavaScript language.
                    It brought several new features like, let and const keyword, rest and spread operators,
                    template literals, classes, modules and many other enhancements to make

                    is 7. It is a primitive datatype which means Symbol cannot be instantiated. Symbols
                    are immutable datatype and act as unique identifiers for object keys.How to implement ES6?
                    Below are the steps to achieve the same.
                    In the package. json file add “type” : “module”. Adding this enables ES6 modules. The package.json
                    file should look like this: package.json. ...
                    Create a file index.js and write the program using ES6 import. For example, let's try to import
                    express in index.js file. index. js file.
